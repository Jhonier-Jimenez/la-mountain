Hi, I created this app, so I could use an external library for the carousel,
in this case I used react-multi-carousel

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-multi-carousel

You can find all of the code I wrote in the 
/src/App.js 
and 
/src/App.css

You can also run the project and see it on your own computer

Just clone the repository
Install npm
and run it with npm start
